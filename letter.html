                        <p>My Dearest,</p>
                        
                        <p>There are moments in life when words feel too small to capture what's in your heart. This is one of those moments. But I'm going to try anyway, because you deserve to know just how much you mean to me.</p>
                        
                        <p>From the very first day we met, something changed in me. It wasn't just the butterflies or the excitement—it was deeper than that. It was a sense of recognition, like my soul had been searching for yours all along. Every laugh we've shared, every conversation that stretched into the early morning hours, every quiet moment just being together—they've all been building something beautiful between us.</p>
                        
                        <p>You've taught me what it means to truly love someone. Not the fairytale version, but the real thing—the kind that shows up even on the hard days, the kind that grows stronger with every challenge we face together. You've shown me patience when I've been difficult, kindness when I've been frustrated, and unwavering support when I've doubted myself.</p>
                        
                        <p>I love the way you light up when you talk about your passions. I love how you make everyone around you feel seen and valued. I love your strength, your gentleness, your humor, and yes, even your stubbornness. I love all the little things that make you uniquely you.</p>
                        
                        <p>As we continue this journey together, I want you to know that I'm all in. Through every adventure, every quiet Sunday morning, every challenge and triumph—I choose you. Today, tomorrow, and every day after that.</p>
                        
                        <p>Thank you for being my partner, my best friend, and my home. Thank you for choosing me too.</p>
                        
                        <p>Happy Birthday, my love. Here's to many more years of making beautiful memories together.</p>
